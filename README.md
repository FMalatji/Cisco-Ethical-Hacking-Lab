# Cisco-Ethical-Hacking-Lab
Offensive security simulation covering network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and web exploitation (SQLi/XSS).
# Cisco Ethical Hacker Certification - Lab Portfolio

## Project Overview
This repository documents the offensive security simulations and practical labs completed as part of the **Cisco Ethical Hacker** certification [2025]. The project focused on the complete hacker lifecycle, from reconnaissance to exploitation and reporting.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
* **Network Scanning:** Nmap (Port scanning, Service version detection)
* **Web Exploitation:** WebSploit (Simulating SQL Injection and XSS attacks)
* **Environment:** Linux CLI
* **Scripting:** Python (Automation of basic security tasks)

## 🔍 Key Engagements
### 1. Network Defense & Enumeration
* Performed active reconnaissance to map attack surfaces.
* Identified open ports and vulnerable services using Nmap.

### 2. Web Application Penetration Testing
* **SQL Injection:** Demonstrated proof-of-concept data exfiltration from a vulnerable test database.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Executed stored XSS payloads to test input sanitization mechanisms.

## 📈 Impact & Reporting
* Documented all findings with severity ratings.
* Proposed mitigation strategies for identified vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, parameterized queries).
